And real-time activity monitoring plays a big part in the quest for insight: if something is broken right now, we need to understand exactly what components are malfunctioning and use that data to quickly make decisions about which course of action to take. <b>The worst thing a DBA can do is to base a decision on an uninformed guess</b>.</p>\n",

The same information could be gleaned within Query Analyzer by using the sp_who or sp_who2 procedures, or by querying the sysprocesses view. While using Query Analyzer made data collection faster than it was from the Enterprise Manager user interface, the information was still of the same level of quality--or lack thereof. The screen shot below illustrates the state of the art information shown by these tools. <b>Session 54 seems to be kind of busy</b>, I guess? I wonder what it’s up to? Well, since I have no clue and the server is slow, <b>I should probably just kill it</b>.</p>\n",

The DBCC INPUTBUFFER command would return information about the most recent SQL batch that had been submitted to the server on behalf of the request. This is much better than simply seeing that session 54 is doing some kind of select, but it’s also quite limiting. The SQL submitted might have been a non-parameterized ad hoc batch, in which case seeing what was happening was easy. But as more and more developers learned to use stored procedures, DBCC INPUTBUFFER often returned something as simple as “EXEC SomeStoredProcedure” – and if the procedure had been called via RPC, it wasn’t even possible to see the parameters that were passed in. (And, I should add, it’s still not possible now. A lot has changed in 13 years, but not enough.)</p>\n",

                "<p>In order to gain more visibility into what was going on on the server, <b>many DBAs forgot about these commands altogether</b> and employed another tool that shipped with SQL Server: Profiler. Most of the DBAs I worked with in the late '90s and early '00s kept Profiler open and attached to the various production instances, all day long. Various information would constantly scroll by and, if there was a problem, the stream could be stopped and the DBA could scroll up and down and try to figure out exactly what the situation was. This technique had its plusses and minuses, to be certain: Profiler showed a lot more information—enough to actually figure out the problem in many cases. But it also showed a lot more information—enough to be overwhelming in many cases. And then there was the fact that Profiler could slow down your entire instance of SQL Server. Which was especially problematic when a whole team of DBAs were all working on the same server, and all had Profiler attached and streaming information. </p>\n",

SQL Server 2005 shipped with a set of new monitoring objects called Dynamic Management Views (DMVs). These objects returned a huge amount of information that had never been available in the SQL Server 2000 system views. Many situations that had previously been possible to debug only by getting information from Profiler or a server-side trace were suddenly possible to deal with by running a few SQL queries. The only problem was that for a long time, <b>no one seemed to know exactly how to write the correct queries</b>.
